# **Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models**

This repo is for the paper Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models.

This work uses the Diffusion-Classifier model proposed in [Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Zero-Shot Classifier](https://github.com/diffusion-classifier/diffusion-classifier)

Create environment
```
conda env create -f enrironment.yml
```

## Fine-tune Diffusion-Classifier
We provide our fine-tuned models with 3 seeds within the 'models/dc' folder. To fine-tune additional models use the following code:


## Fine-tune CLIP
We provide our 3 fine-tuned models within the 'models/clip' folder. To fine-tune additional models run the following code:


## Run models on data
